Bayes Mock Python Assessment
============================

The line below lets us use all the functions we've defined in
``mock_assessment.py``. We'll go into more detail in the imports lesson, don't
worry about it too much right now.

>>> from mock_assessment import *

1. Define a function named ``normalize_name``. It should accept a string and
   return a valid python identifier, that is:

    - anything that is not a valid python identifier should be removed
    - leading and trailing whitespace should be removed
    - everything should be lowercase
    - spaces should be replaced with underscores
    - for example:
        - ``Name`` will become ``name``
        - ``First Name  `` will become ``first_name``
        - ``% Completed`` will become ``completed``

    >>> normalize_name('Name')
    'name'
    >>> normalize_name('First Name  ')
    'first_name'
    >>> normalize_name('% Completed')
    'completed'

1. Write a function named ``cumsum`` that accepts a list of numbers and returns
   a list that is the cumulative sum of the numbers in the list.

    - ``cumsum([1, 1, 1])`` returns ``[1, 2, 3]``
    - ``cumsum([1, 2, 3, 4])`` returns ``[1, 3, 6, 10]``

    >>> cumsum([1, 1, 1])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> cumsum([1, 2, 3, 4])
    [1, 3, 6, 10]
